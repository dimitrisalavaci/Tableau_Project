### Assignment Questions

1. Detect different data types in your data - Which important data type is missing?
- The data is from FIFA 18, however we are missing the start and finish date for it. We're not sure if the data is for the 2017-2018 season or if it's for the calendar year 2018.
2. This table has 70 different features. Can you detect the most important features ? Why do you think these are important? Could you define a question for yourself? Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them.
- There are a lot of features that are only useful if a specific question is asked. For example, the position stats(RAM, LAM, CAM, ST, LW, RW, CB, etc) are only useful if your question specially involves that position. However there are a lot of other features that are quite useful in many instances. These features include(age, nationality, club, wage, value, overall) and can be used in muliple instaces to get different information that is useful.

### Answers

1. Syria had the highest average wage. I found it quite surprising but it makes sense because they are a small nation with not as footballers. The top 10 was full of small countries and it was expected since the less population you have the higher an average value can be.
2. The top 5 players would be Neymar, Messi, Ronaldo, Griezmann and Bale.
3. The usual suspects(biggest clubs in the world) Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United are the top in in highest player wages. Surprisingly, Everton made the top 10 which is shocking to be honest since they are nowhere near the size of any of the clubs in the top 10 yet are competing with them for highest salary. This is an indication that Everton are being run badly as a football club.
4. The teams with the highest rated players are again Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United which makes sense because you pay more for high value players and since they have the highest wage bills it makes sense for them to have the highest rated players. On the other hand, Everton are not on this list which is another pointer to them being run badly as a football club as they are spending money but not on quality players.
5. Based on the data it seems like teams with a low average age and a high average age have the smaller average wages and teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona are two outliers that have outrages wage averages and stand out the most.
7. The top 15 are: 
    - Balotelli
    - Ibrahimovic
    - Fabinho 
    - T. Simons
    - P. Verhaegh
    - Baines
    - Perotti
    - Toure
    - Kruse 
    - Castro
    - Inan 
    - Haller
    - David Villa
    - Reus
    - Ben Arfa
8. The top 3 would be Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar. There is no surprise there are they the 3 best players in the world especially in 2018.
