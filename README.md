# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

- Use the FIFA2018 dataset and create visualizations using tableau
- Gather information that is useful to companies or football managers from those visualizations
- Use the given data to find any outliers/any values that may skew the data

## Process

- Download dataset
- Create visualizations to understand data
- List important features
- Create more visualizations based on those features 
- Create questions to answer
- Create dashboard using visualizations to answer questions

## Results

- I chose option 2 and selected the FIFA 2018 dataset
- Created visualizations that were of interest to me
- Made a role playing scenario where I worked for a company that was gathering information on the financial side of football, but also worked for a football club as a scout and having the manager give me attributes that he's looking for in players and wants me to come back with a shortlist of 5-15 players based on those attributes
- I was able to find which clubs the best players played for, whether or not those clubs had the highest wage bill, I was also able to find which nations had the highest average wage for the players that represented them(this was the most shocking data I found until I started to think about it logically and realized it's actually accurate)
- In this dataset following my questions, I was also able to find out who the highest rated players were for the lowest value

## Challenges 

- A challenge I faced was that there was no date value in this specific dataset so I was unsure if the data was from the 2017-2018 season or from the 2018 calendar year
- This made difficult to come to some conclusions and I was able to create certain question due to this value missing
- Also was not able to forcast any values since there was no date value


## Future Goals

- If I had more time I would create different questions in order to use more of the dataset and come to different conclusions
- In the future if there was a way to track weekly player performances and update their ratings based on their performance and collect this information, there would be more data to use and we would have the ability to forecast players future ratings, values, wages, abilities whereas in this dataset we werenâ€™t able to
